### Project 1: The Basics

This is a sample end-to-end data-science/machine-learning project to illustrate the basic concepts using a real-world dataset, including data exploration, preprocessing, and model training, selection and fine-tuning. It was inspired by Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow*, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O'Reilly).
